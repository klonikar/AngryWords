<title> AngryWords Android App Privacy Policy </title>
</head>
<body>
<ul>
<li>This app asks for permissions like android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO, android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE.</li>

<li>These permissions are needed because media playing framework/APIs using by this app require these permissions.</li>

<li>The app is open source (on github) and it can be easily verified that the app does not record audio or read phone state.</li>

<li>The network access permission is needed to load the even offline web content like images and audio.</li>

<li>Although the app asks for Internet/Network, camera, device ID and call information permissions, it does not use them to record audio or connect to internet or determine device state. It is a completely offline app.</li>

<li>No private data is recorded, stored, or sent over the internet.</li>

</ul>
